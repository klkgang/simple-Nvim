<h1>HOW TO INSTALL?</h1>

## Dependencies 

**before continuing with the instaltion**




### Step One
First, ensure that Neovim is installed on your system, and you have a .config directory for the configuration. If you don't see the .config directory in your home directory, create it by running:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
```

### Step two 

Set everything up with this command
```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim/ && git clone https://github.com/klkgang/simple-Nvim/ && cd simple-Nvim && mv * .. && cd .. && rm -rf simple-Nvim
```

That's it! Now simply run nvim and start exploring the configuration.
